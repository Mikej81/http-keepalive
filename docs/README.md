## Documentation Principles

Our documentation follows these principles:

### Human-Centered
- Written for real people, not just experts
- Explains the "why" behind decisions, not just the "how"
- Uses plain language without sacrificing technical accuracy

### Beginner-Inclusive
- Assumes curiosity, not prior knowledge
- Defines technical terms and acronyms
- Provides context and background information

### Practical
- Includes working examples you can copy and paste
- Covers common scenarios and edge cases
- Addresses real-world deployment considerations

### Comprehensive
- Covers all major use cases
- Includes troubleshooting guidance
- Explains configuration options and their implications

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Be specific**: Include exact commands, file paths, and error messages
2. **Provide context**: Explain when and why to use different options
3. **Test examples**: Ensure all code examples actually work
4. **Update cross-references**: Keep links between documents current
5. **Consider your audience**: Write for the intended reader's experience level

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Read existing docs** to understand the current structure and style
2. **Follow the style guide** established in existing documents
3. **Test your changes** by following your own instructions
4. **Update related sections** that might be affected by your changes
5. **Review for consistency** with the rest of the documentation

## Getting Help

If you need clarification on any documentation:

1. Check the troubleshooting sections in relevant documents

3. When reporting documentation issues, include:
   - Which document you were reading
   - What you were trying to accomplish
   - What step didn't work as expected
   - Your environment details (OS, Docker version, etc.)
